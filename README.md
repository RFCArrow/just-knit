# just-knit
Final year project to develop a device for classifying knitting stiches in realtime to make knitting patterns easier to follow.

I2C address of MPU9250 was hardcoded into library by Sparkfun. Much unpicking revealed that it comes from "struct hw_s hw" hidden in "MPU9250/src/util/inv_mpu.c"
